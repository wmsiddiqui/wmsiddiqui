				Welcome to my website! This website was created using React and Redux. I've used the GitHub APIs to
				display some up to date information about my projects. The code is then built and hosted on GitHub
				pages. At the time of making this website, Redux was probably not needed, since I really don't need a
				central store at the moment. I also have a few projects written in Node.js and C# which you can check
				out on my GitHub. Just click the "Projects" link in the navigation bar and check them out!
